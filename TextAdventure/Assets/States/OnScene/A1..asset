  storyText: 'The odor of cigarettes and cat litter assaults your nose as you enter
    the apartment. Dirty laundry and trash decorate every inch of the floor. You
    find your patient sitting on a pile of clothes on the floor. He appears to be
    pale and diaphoretic.

    

    What is your first action:

    

    1.
    Ask the patient if he can walk to the gurney.

    

    2. Put the patient
    on the monitor and obtain baseline vital signs.'
